5. Story pitch: Taking a look at a specific industry that struggled especially hard during the pandemic and that received targeted funding from the federal government and see how it has recovered or rebounded financially since lockdowns have ended.

    For example, I covered independent music venues sucessfully lobbying for targeted government stimulus during my internship with Fortune, which resulted in the passing of the Save Our Stages Act (later renamed SVOG) in the beginning of the year. Still, it took months before the SBA even began allowing venues to apply for stimulus, let alone before they received any funding. Iâ€™d be curious to look at the data and see how that money has since been distributed and how much those venues have been able to gain back in revenue since vaccines became widely available and venues have reopened.
