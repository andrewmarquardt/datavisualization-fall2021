5. **Story pitch:** 

    Taking a look at a specific industry that struggled especially hard during the pandemic and that received targeted funding from the federal government and see how it has recovered or rebounded financially since lockdowns have ended.

    For example, I covered independent music venues sucessfully lobbying for targeted government stimulus during my internship with Fortune, which resulted in the passing of the Save Our Stages Act (later renamed SVOG) in the beginning of the year. Still, it took months before the SBA even began allowing venues to apply for stimulus, let alone before they received any funding. I’d be curious to look at the data and see how that money has since been distributed and how much those venues have been able to gain back in revenue since vaccines became widely available and venues have reopened. I have a lot of sources from different venue owners from previous stories that I could reach back out to. I'd also reach out to the SBA to get more info about how much money was distributed and to whom. 

4. [Story Critique:](https://www.timesonline.com/news/20180107/making-living-off-of-selling-death-from-dealers-to-addicts-opioid-crisis-has-tentacles-that-reach-deep-into-beaver-county-communities)


    **Clarity and Accuracy**
    
    
     Very clear (5.) The author converys the extent to which the opioid crisis has affected Beaver County by combining personal anecdotes with statistics and context that explained just how bad the issue has become and how. 
                - Yes, definitely in the headline: ‘Making a living off of selling death’: From dealers to addicts, opioid crisis has tentacles that reach deep into Beaver County communities
     
     I give this graph a 4. It was clear from the data visualization the author wanted the reader to understand that fentanyl is responsible for far more deaths in Beaver County than any other drug, with the worst coming in 2016. By comparing the number of deaths by year, it also became very clear from the graph just how quickly this issue went from being nonexistent to fentanly killing almost 100 Beaver County residents in a year. 
                - It may have been a bit easier to read if the reader did not have to swivel the mouse over each bar to understand what it meant. The message still gets across, but it takes some effort from the reader that perhaps could be eliminated if the data were presented differently. 
        - I definitelt think the data was accurate. While the graph doesn't directly source its information, the data is presented throughout the article and the author is sure to credit the data's source: the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.


    **Quality**
    
    
    I definitely think this article/graph were done to the highest quality (5.) It was well researched, in that the author did their homework finding all the right statistics, and it was powerful in that the author included personal anecdotes that allowed the reader to understand just how detrimental to Beaver County the opioid epidemic has become. 
    
 
   **Type and Color** 
   
   There weren't any graphics in this story, but it featured a nice graph where color was important in differentiating between years, as each color represented a different year. While the colors didn't necessarily make sense as they correlated to each year, it didn't detract from the effectiveness of the graph. 
   
   **Creativity**
   
   At the beginning of the piece was a picture slideshow showing the families and their loved ones who fell victimn to the opioid epidemic in Beaver County. This was definitely effective in immediately giving the reader a glimpse into the sorrow the crisis is bringing to so many families in the county, and across the country. One critique I have about the graph is that it is featured at the very bottom of a pretty lenghty story. I think this probably leads readers to skip the graph. It woul have more value if it were placed inside the story, so that it could reinforce statistics that are mentioned in the story and so it doesn't come across as an after-thought. Otherwise, it's an effective graph that was well executed. For these reasons I give the article's creativity a 3.
