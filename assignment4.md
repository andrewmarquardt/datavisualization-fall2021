# Assignment 4: Interview a Dataset

## Ron Johnson FEC Data

### [Original data](https://github.com/andrewmarquardt/datavisualization-fall2021/files/7455867/johnson_opensecrets.csv)

### [Cleaned Data](https://github.com/andrewmarquardt/datavisualization-fall2021/files/7455873/johnson_opensecrets1.csv)
    
I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns, leaving only what will be useful for our final project.

### Questions:

What percentage of contributers are not from Wisconsin - the state Johnson represents?

Which three conrtibutors have given the most to Johnson's campaign? Are they from Wisconsin?
